    "Parameters when creating an agent:\n",
    "* **Tool:** A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n",
    "* **LLM:** The language model powering the agent.\n",
    "* **Agent:** The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents.
